# Breeze Deep Analysis

Perform deep analysis of a user prompt across the Breeze functional, design, and code graphs to understand full context before acting.

## Your Task

Given a user prompt, search all three Breeze graphs, perform a deep analysis, present a summary, and — if the user wants — generate a comprehensive document with diagrams.

## Step 1 — Read Project Config

Read `.breeze.json` to get the `projectUuid`. If it doesn't exist, respond with: "No Breeze project configured. Skipping analysis."

## Step 2 — Search All Three Graphs (in parallel)

Run these three searches simultaneously using queries derived from the user's prompt:

1. **Functional Graph Search** (`Functional_Graph_Search`)
   Search for related personas, outcomes, scenarios, steps, and actions.

2. **Design Graph Search** (`Design_Graph_Search`)
   Search for related user journeys, flows, pages, and components.

3. **Code Graph Search** (`Code_Graph_Search`)
   Search for related code files, classes, methods, and modules.

If a search returns no results, note "No matches found" for that graph.

## Step 2.1 — Functional Drill-Down

Based on the Functional_Graph_Search results, drill deeper into the functional graph:

1. ALWAYS call `Get_all_personas` first to get the full persona list with their IDs.
2. For outcomes/scenarios returned by the search, match the `personaId` field in each outcome back to the persona list to identify which personas are affected.
3. Call `Get_all_outcomes_for_a_persona_id` for each affected persona to get their full outcome list.
4. Call `Get_all_scenarios_for_a_outcome_id` for each relevant outcome.
5. For each relevant scenario, call `Get_all_steps_actions_for_a_scenario_id` to get the complete steps and actions.

This gives you the full functional chain: Persona → Outcome → Scenario → Steps → Actions.

## Step 3 — Deep Analysis

Synthesize results from all three graphs into a deep analysis. Think across layers:

- **What does this prompt mean functionally?** — Which personas are involved, what outcomes/scenarios are touched, what business logic is relevant.
- **What does this mean from a design perspective?** — Which UI flows, pages, components are related, what user journeys are affected.
- **What does this mean at the code level?** — Which files, modules, classes, methods implement the relevant functionality.
- **How are these connected?** — Trace the thread from functional requirement → design element → code implementation. Identify gaps where one layer exists but another doesn't.
- **What are the dependencies and risks?** — Upstream/downstream effects, shared components, breaking change potential.

## Step 4 — Return Analysis Summary

Return the deep analysis to the main conversation as a concise but informative summary:

```
Breeze Deep Analysis

Functional Context:
  - Personas: <list of relevant personas>
  - Scenarios: <list of relevant scenario names>
  - Key Actions: <most relevant actions/steps>

Design Context:
  - User Journeys: <related journeys>
  - Flows/Pages: <related flows and pages>
  - Components: <related UI components>

Code Context:
  - Files: <related source files>
  - Modules/Classes: <related modules>
  - Key Methods: <relevant methods/functions>

Feature Traceability:
  <how functional → design → code are linked for this prompt>

Risk Level: <Low/Medium/High> — <one-line justification>
```

IMPORTANT: After presenting this summary, explicitly ask the user:

"Would you like me to generate a detailed analysis document with diagrams for this? (yes/no)"

## Rules

- Always search ALL three graphs, even if the prompt seems to only affect one area.
- The summary should be informative but concise — the detailed doc comes later if requested.
- If all three graphs return no results, report "No relevant context found in any graph" and skip the doc offer.
- Do not modify or interfere with the user's original prompt — your job is analysis only.
