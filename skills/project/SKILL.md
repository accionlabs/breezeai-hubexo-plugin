  Full Breeze project management: show, list, switch (use), create,
  auth, status, and full bootstrap (setup). Use for: "which project
  am I on", "list projects", "switch project", "set project", "create
  project", mid-session project changes, MCP re-authentication, and
  first-time workspace bootstrap. This is the canonical home for all
  project-management operations. The legacy `/breeze:setup-project`
  is a backward-compatible alias for `/breeze:project setup`.
---

## Guard

Most modes here require an authenticated Breeze MCP session. The
`auth` and `setup` modes handle the auth handshake themselves; all
other modes (`show`, `list`, `use`, `create`, `status`) assume an
active session and surface a clear error pointing at
`/breeze:project auth` if they hit a 401.

---

## Mode dispatch

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and dispatch:

| `$ARGUMENTS` shape | Mode |
|---|---|
| empty / whitespace | **show** — print active project + summary |
| `list` (case-insensitive) | **list** — print all accessible projects |
| `use <value>` | **switch** — resolve `<value>` and update `.breeze.json` |
| `auth` (case-insensitive) | **auth** — MCP authentication handshake |
| `create <name> [--description "..."]` | **create** — create a new project and link |
| `status` (case-insensitive) | **status** — full metadata report (alias of `show`) |
| `setup` (case-insensitive) | **setup** — full bootstrap (auth + link/create + status) |
| anything else | print the usage hint and stop |

Usage hint (for unknown args):

    Usage:
      /breeze:project                              show currently active project
      /breeze:project list                         list all accessible projects
      /breeze:project use <name|uuid>              switch and persist
      /breeze:project create <name> [--desc "..."] create a new project and link
      /breeze:project auth                         re-authenticate the MCP session
      /breeze:project status                       full metadata report on active project
      /breeze:project setup                        full bootstrap (auth + link + status)

---

## Cross-project queries within an invocation

If a request requires data from a project *other than* the one
currently linked in `.breeze.json` — e.g., comparing V1 and V2 in one
analysis, or cross-referencing a sister project — pass the target
`uuid` directly to each MCP tool call. Do NOT silently mutate
`.breeze.json` to switch projects mid-invocation. Only the `use`,
`create`, and `setup` modes of this skill (when the user explicitly
invokes them) may modify `.breeze.json`.

---

## Mode: show (no args)

1. Read `.breeze.json`. If missing or `projectUuid` absent, respond:

       No project currently linked. Options:
       - /breeze:project setup    — initial link + MCP auth
       - /breeze:project list     — see what's available
       - /breeze:project use <X>  — link to an existing project

   Then stop.

2. Call `Call_Get_Project_Details_` with the existing `projectUuid`.

3. Render:

       Active project: <name>  (<uuid>)
       Status:         <status>
       Version:        <version>
       Author:         <author.firstName> <author.lastName> <author.email>
       Description:    <metadata.description or "—">

4. Short hint at the bottom:

       Switch with:    /breeze:project use <name-or-uuid>
       See all:        /breeze:project list

If `Call_Get_Project_Details_` returns empty / 404, treat the previously
linked project as gone: tell the user the link is stale and offer
`/breeze:project list` + `/breeze:project use <name>` (or
`/breeze:project setup` to start fresh).

---

## Mode: list

1. Call `Call_List_Project_` (limit high enough to capture all — start
   with 50, paginate if `total` exceeds).

2. Read `.breeze.json` to get the current `projectUuid` (if any).

3. Render as a monospace table:

       UUID                                     Name                Status    Active
       ─────────────────────────────────────    ───────────────     ──────    ──────
       4f803786-60d9-4f66-b719-c51a84a7df40     Lead Manager V1     active    ←
       69944bfe-366d-4bc7-8586-4e0b04901e24     Lead Manager V2     active
       bf6cfa91-9495-41ce-93d7-36d45ddeaae1     ETL & Harvestor     active

   Mark the row whose UUID matches `.breeze.json`'s `projectUuid` with
   an `←` arrow in the Active column. If `.breeze.json` is missing or
   empty, omit the Active column entirely and add a note: "No project
   currently linked."

4. Footer:

       Switch with:  /breeze:project use <name-or-uuid>

---

## Mode: switch (`use <value>`)

1. Extract `<value>` from `$ARGUMENTS` (everything after `use`).

2. Call `Call_List_Project_` and resolve `<value>`:

   - **Exact UUID match** → one match, proceed.
   - **Exact name match (case-insensitive)** → one match, proceed.
   - **Unambiguous substring of name (case-insensitive)** → one match, proceed.
   - **Zero matches** → stop. List available projects (name + UUID).
     Do NOT mutate `.breeze.json`.
   - **Multiple matches** → stop. Show all matches and ask the user to
     disambiguate by UUID. Do NOT mutate.

3. Read `.breeze.json` (may not exist).

   - If it exists: preserve every other key; update only `projectUuid`.
   - If it does not exist: create it with `{"projectUuid": "<uuid>"}`.

4. Render confirmation:

       Switched to: <name>  (<uuid>)
       Previously:  <previous name or "(none)">
       .breeze.json updated.

5. Footer:

       Next: any /breeze:* skill will now use this project.
       For a one-shot override that does NOT touch .breeze.json, use
       --project <name> on any individual skill invocation.

---

## Mode: auth

The Breeze MCP server handles authentication via a browser handshake;
no API key is stored locally.

1. Attempt a lightweight MCP call (e.g. `Call_List_Project_` with
   `limit: 1`) to test the current session.

2. If it succeeds → respond:

       MCP session is already authenticated.

   Then stop.

3. If it fails with an auth error, run the handshake:

   a. Call `mcp__breeze-mcp__authenticate` to start the flow. The
      tool returns an authentication URL.

   b. Share the URL with the user and ask them to complete sign-in
      in their browser.

   c. Once they confirm completion, call
      `mcp__breeze-mcp__complete_authentication` to finalize the
      session.

   d. Retry the lightweight call to verify the session is now live.

   e. Render:

          MCP session re-authenticated.

      Then stop.

   If verification still fails after this flow, ask the user to retry
   `/breeze:project auth` or check their network / SSO.

---

## Mode: create (`create <name> [--description "..."]`)

1. Parse `<name>` and optional `--description "..."` from
   `$ARGUMENTS` (everything after `create`).

2. Require `<name>` to be non-empty. If absent, stop with the usage
   hint.

3. Confirm with the user before creating:

       Create new project '<name>' with description '<desc-or-(none)>'?
       (yes/no)

   On `no`, stop without creating.

4. Call `Call_Create_Project_` with the name and description. Capture
   the returned `projectUuid`.

5. Read `.breeze.json` (may not exist).

   - If it exists: preserve every other key; update only `projectUuid`
     to the new project's UUID.
   - If it does not exist: create it with `{"projectUuid": "<uuid>"}`.

6. Render confirmation:

       Created project: <name>  (<uuid>)
       .breeze.json updated.

7. Footer:

       Next: any /breeze:* skill will now use this project.

---

## Mode: status

Alias of `show` (no args). Same metadata report. Call this when you
want to be explicit about asking for project status rather than
relying on the no-args default.

---

## Mode: setup

Full workspace bootstrap. Performs auth → link/create → status in one
flow. This is the canonical home for what was previously
`/breeze:setup-project` (which is now a backward-compatible alias for
this mode).

1. **Auth check.** Run the steps in Mode: auth. If auth fails
   permanently, stop.

2. **Read `.breeze.json`** and remember whether `projectUuid` was
   already present.

3. **No existing `projectUuid` (first-time link)** — ask:

       Would you like to:
       1. Select an existing project
       2. Create a new project

   - On 1 → run "select existing" sub-flow below.
   - On 2 → run "create new" sub-flow below.

4. **Existing `projectUuid` (confirm / switch)** —

   a. Call `Call_Get_Project_Details_` with the existing UUID to
      identify the current project.

   b. Ask:

          You're currently linked to **{currentProject.name}**
          (`{currentProject.uuid}`). Would you like to:
          1. Keep this project (just show its status)
          2. Switch to a different existing project
          3. Create a new project

   c. Route on the answer:

      - **Keep** → continue to Step 6 (status report).
      - **Switch** → run "select existing" sub-flow below, then
        overwrite `projectUuid` in `.breeze.json`.
      - **Create new** → run "create new" sub-flow below, then
        overwrite `projectUuid` in `.breeze.json`.

   If `Call_Get_Project_Details_` returns empty / 404 for the
   existing UUID, treat the link as gone and fall through to the
   first-time prompt in step 3.

5. **Sub-flows:**

   - **Select existing:** Call `Call_List_Project_`, display the
     project list (name + UUID), user selects one, save its UUID to
     `.breeze.json` (preserving other keys).

   - **Create new:** Ask for project name and optional description.
     Call `Call_Create_Project_`. Save the returned `projectUuid` to
     `.breeze.json` (preserving other keys).

6. **Status report** (same as Mode: show / Mode: status). Render the
   metadata report for the now-linked project.

7. **Next-step guidance:**

       Your project is linked. Next:

       - /breeze:project              view / list / switch project
       - /breeze:search <question>    explore the graph
       - /breeze:impact-analysis      cross-layer blast radius
       - /breeze:generate-spec        export a functional specification

       Each analysis skill also accepts --project <name|uuid> for a
       one-shot, non-persistent override.

---

## Rules

- **Modes that write `.breeze.json`**: `use`, `create`, `setup` (when
  it ends up linking or creating). All other modes are pure reads.
- **Modes that touch auth**: `auth`, `setup`. All other modes assume
  an active session and surface a clear error pointing at
  `/breeze:project auth` if they hit 401.
- **This skill never probes individual graphs** (functional / design /
  code / architecture). For graph status, use `/breeze:search`.
- **Per-invocation `--project` overrides on analysis skills are
  outside this skill's scope.** This skill manages the persisted
  active project via `.breeze.json`. Per-invocation overrides belong
  to `search`, `impact-analysis`, `generate-spec`.
- **Never mutate `.breeze.json` outside `use` / `create` / `setup`.**
  For cross-project queries within an invocation, pass `uuid`
  directly to MCP tool calls instead of switching the active project.
- **When in doubt** between `setup` and `use`: use `setup` for
  first-time link or when you suspect auth might be broken; use `use`
  for a fast mid-session switch on an already-authenticated session.
- **Backward compatibility:** `/breeze:setup-project` continues to
  work as a thin alias for `/breeze:project setup`. Behavior is
  identical.
